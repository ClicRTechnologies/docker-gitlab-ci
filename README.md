# END OF LIFE

Since version `8.0` GitLab CI has been merged into GitLab CE. You no longer need to setup a separate CI instance.

Refer to https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab/blob/master/CI_MIGRATION.md for the migration instructions.

**PSA:** *BACKUP YOUR DATA BEFORE MIGRATING*

If you are interested in older versions of GitLab CI, please refer to the README of the tagged versions.
